"""
The WebUI server.

Deliberately built on the standard library's HTTP server: this project's value is
in the signal model, and a framework dependency would buy nothing here while
adding install friction.  Long work (renders) runs on worker threads and reports
progress through a job table the page polls, so the HTTP loop never blocks.
